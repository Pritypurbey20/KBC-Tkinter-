# KBC-Tkinter
Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications.
Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.

And implementing Tkinter library in my program I made KBC(Kaun banega crorepatti) game and also added the concept of 50-50 lifeline in it.
